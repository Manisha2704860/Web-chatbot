# Web-chatbot

# What I built?

I built a simple rule-based chatbot using Flask, a Python web framework. The chatbot can understand basic user inputs and respond accordingly. It can answer questions, tell jokes, display the current time, and provide basic assistance.


# Why I built it?

I built this chatbot to:

1. Demonstrate a simple chatbot: The code demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using Flask and a rule-based system.
2. Provide basic assistance: The chatbot can provide basic assistance to users, such as answering questions and telling jokes.
3. Showcase conversation history: The chatbot's conversation history feature allows users to see previous interactions.
   
# How it works?

The chatbot works as follows:

1. User input: The user types a message in the input field and submits it.
2. Processing: The chatbot processes the user input using a rule-based system, which matches the input to predefined responses.
3. Response: The chatbot generates a response based on the matched rule and displays it to the user.
4. Conversation history: The chatbot stores the conversation history, allowing users to see previous interactions.
